<p>Virtual assistants are becoming nowadays extremely popular. Chatbots are used everyday for customer support, shopping, education, entertainment and many other purposes.</p>

<p>This app is designed for developers who build conversational interfaces based on the api.ai technology. Api.ai (<a href="https://api.ai">https://api.ai</a>) is a popular platform for creating artificial intelligence agents which can be easily integrated into apps, webpages and physical devices.</p>

<p>The “AI Tester” iPad app allows simultaneous testing and comparing of several artificial intelligence agents.</p>

<h3>
<a id="demo-test-and-agents" class="anchor" href="#demo-test-and-agents" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demo test and agents</h3>

<p>The “AI Tester” app contains one demo test and three demo agents. Since these are only demo agents, they were trained with a limited corpora of knowledge. Nevertheless, you can greet them and ask basic questions.</p>

<p>You are also highly welcome to create and train your own agents for free at <a href="https://api.ai">https://api.ai</a> and add them to the “AI Tester” by using only the agent’s “Client access token”.</p>
